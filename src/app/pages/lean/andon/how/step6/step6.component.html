          <strong>Operation:</strong> Train employees on how to trigger an alert, interpret indicators, and respond appropriately. This includes:
          <ul>
            <li>Understanding the different types of alerts and their meanings.</li>
            <li>Learning how to manually trigger an alert using buttons or cords.</li>
            <li>Recognizing automated alerts generated by sensors and systems.</li>
            <li>Knowing the immediate steps to take when an alert is triggered, such as stopping the production line or calling for assistance.</li>
          </ul>
          Proper training ensures that employees can quickly and accurately respond to alerts, minimizing downtime and maintaining safety.

          <strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Define clear roles and responsibilities for different levels of alerts. This includes:
          <ul>
            <li>Identifying who is responsible for responding to specific types of alerts.</li>
            <li>Ensuring supervisors and managers are aware of their roles in investigating and resolving issues.</li>
            <li>Establishing protocols for escalating alerts to higher levels of management if necessary.</li>
            <li>Providing ongoing training and refreshers to keep everyone up-to-date with procedures and best practices.</li>
          </ul>
          Clearly defined responsibilities ensure that there is no confusion during an alert, and that issues are resolved efficiently.
