        Install and integrate the chosen visual indicators with your workspace. Proper implementation ensures that the Andon system is effective and accessible to all team members:

        <div class="row mt-4">
          <div class="col-md-6 mb-4 mb-md-0">
            <div class="text-container">
              <div class="mt-3">
                <nb-icon icon="bulb-outline" class="icon-large" [options]="{ animation: { type: 'pulse' } }"></nb-icon>
                <strong>Lights:</strong> Mount Andon lights in locations where they are easily visible to all relevant personnel. Consider the following:
                <ul>
                  <li>Install lights at key points along the production line to ensure visibility from various angles.</li>
                  <li>Use high-mounted lights for large workspaces or areas with obstructions.</li>
                  <li>Ensure lights are color-coded (e.g., green for normal operation, yellow for attention, red for stoppage) and visible from a distance.</li>
                </ul>
                Proper placement of lights helps in quickly signaling the status of operations to everyone on the floor.

          <strong>Boards:</strong> Set up digital displays or physical boards in strategic locations. These boards should be:
          <ul>
            <li>Placed at entrances or central points where they can be easily seen by all team members.</li>
            <li>Large enough to display critical information clearly.</li>
            <li>Updated in real-time to provide accurate data on the current status of operations.</li>
          </ul>
          Digital boards can be integrated with your systems for automatic updates, while physical boards should be maintained regularly.

        Implementing visual controls effectively requires planning and consideration of the workspace layout. Ensure that all team members are trained on how to interpret the visual indicators and respond appropriately. Regular maintenance and updates are essential to keep the Andon system reliable and functional.
