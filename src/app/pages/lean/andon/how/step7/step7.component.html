              <strong>Escalation:</strong> Define who to notify for each level of alert to ensure the right personnel are informed and can take action. Consider the following steps:
              <ul>
                <li>Identify the specific individuals or roles responsible for responding to different types of alerts.</li>
                <li>Establish a chain of command for escalating alerts from operators to team leaders, supervisors, and maintenance staff.</li>
                <li>Ensure that contact information and communication channels (e.g., phone, email, radio) are readily available and regularly updated.</li>
                <li>Develop criteria for when and how alerts should be escalated to higher levels of management or external support teams.</li>
              </ul>
              Clear escalation procedures help in quickly mobilizing the appropriate response and minimizing downtime.

              <strong>Resolution:</strong> Establish standard procedures for addressing and resolving issues promptly. This includes:
              <ul>
                <li>Creating step-by-step guides for common issues and their resolutions.</li>
                <li>Ensuring that all necessary tools and resources are available to address problems as they arise.</li>
                <li>Training personnel on troubleshooting techniques and the use of diagnostic equipment.</li>
                <li>Implementing a feedback loop to review resolved issues and improve procedures continuously.</li>
                <li>Documenting each incident, including the actions taken and the outcome, to build a knowledge base for future reference.</li>
              </ul>
              Standardized resolution procedures ensure consistency and effectiveness in handling alerts.
